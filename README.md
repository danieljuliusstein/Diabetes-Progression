- The diabetes dataset is loaded using load_diabetes.
- A DataFrame is created, including the target variable (progression).
- A scatter plot is then generated to show the relationship between BMI and disease progression.
- Features (X) and target variable (y) are separated.
- The dataset is split into training and validation sets using train_test_split.
- A RandomForestRegressor is initialized and trained on the training data.
- Predictions are made on both a sample of the dataset and the validation set.
- The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Outputs: 

- A scatter plot of BMI vs. progression.
- Predictions for the first few samples.
- Mean Absolute Error on the validation set.
